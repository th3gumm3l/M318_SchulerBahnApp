## Project
The aim of this exercise is to programme an application that uses the timetable data of the Swiss public transport system. The application should make it possible to search for transport connections between two stations. The assessment of this project work is the basis for the final grade.

### Requirements
In the chapter Analysing project requirements, you have to create user stories from the customer's statements. During implementation, you must adhere to these user stories and implement them.

## Documentation
No documentation in the actual sense is required. However, a document containing the following information is required as a minimum.
- Author, date
- Table of contents
- An introduction (management summary).
- Purpose of the document.
- If certain functions have only been partially implemented: Which ones? What part of the functionality is still missing? Known errors/bugs?
- Mockups for all forms/dialogues (GUI) needed to cover the requirements with priority 1.
- User stories with acceptance criteria and status (whether they have been implemented or not).
- Activity diagram for a user story with the highest priority.
- Test cases (system tests), written in an understandable and unambiguous way so that a tester can perform them without further explanation.
- Test protocol with date of execution of the tests, name of the tester and logging of the actual test results.
- Installation instructions: How is the software installed? How is the software uninstalled?
- Other exciting information for the evaluation.
The documentation should be neatly designed, correct in content and clearly structured. Pay attention to typography and spelling!
